# Matlab code for Gaussian Fitting in mass-spectrometry data

This is the code for the paper

This Matlab code is modified from Kristensen (2012).

Matlab codes for Gaussian fitting. ConsGaussFit05082016 is the main function. Others are supporting functions.
Instructions are in the comments of ConsGaussFit05082016.

# Data Format
The format of the input data table: should have one string column of protein ID and a header row. Other columns are protein intensities.

# Instructions
To use the code, set the folder where the codes are put together, to be the working directory.
use command:
ConsGaussFit05082016('SEC_Bio1_nov.csv','sec1-2015nov20160508','plot-2015nov20160508','peakloc-2015nov20160508')

The first argument is input data
Second is output folder name
Third is plot names
Forth is the table of peak locations

# Description of files
consExp.m, consExp3.m, consExp4.m are the functions of 2, 3, 4 Gaussian peaks. Peaks are separated 

normprob.m is used to calculate peak areas.

The code contains peakfinder.m, which is another way to find peaks. Also please download all code files from this page.
